# Parafoil_landing_with_DRL
Utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve the precision landing of an autonomous parafoil system. Specifically, the policy
network is trained by the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, and the parafoil dynamics are described using the six-degree-of-freedom model.
